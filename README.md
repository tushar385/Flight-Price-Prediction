# Flight-Price-Prediction

## Introduction

Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. We might have often heard travellers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable. Huh! Here we take on the challenge! As data scientists, we are gonna prove that given the right data anything can be predicted.

 The goal of our proposed framework is to draw a comprehensive proÔ¨Åle of each market and uses machine learning techniques to predict the average airfare on market segment level.
